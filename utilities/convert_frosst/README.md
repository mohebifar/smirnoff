# Conversion of modified frcmod files into SMIRFFF FFXML format

## Manifest
* `convert_frcmod.py` - python script to convert a frcmod file (`example.frcmod`) into a SMIRFF ffxml file by parsing the parameters and inserting them into a template ffxml.
* `example.frcmod` - example modified frcmod file which contains SMIRKS in the place of normal AMBER atom types in the parameter definitions
* `template.ffxml` - template SMIRFF FFXML file which the parameters from the frcmod file will be inserted into; already contains relevant force sections but not the paramters themselves.
* `example.ffxml` - converted SMIRFF FFXML as generated by convert_frcmod.py
* `example_plusgeneric.ffxml` - example which takes a generated file created by convert_frcmod.py and adds some generic types as parameter 0 under each force that ensure the result covers all atom types.
* `parameter_usage.ipynb` - example notebook (requested by Bayly) which shows how to determine which molecules do/do not contain a specific parameter.
