Converting parm99 to a smirff
-----------------------------
This is part of getting a smirff for parm@Frosst: since parm@Frosst is
read in as a frcmod on top of parm99, this means parm99 must be the
initial smirff. The overall principle is not to make an exact replica
of parm99 as a smirff but rather to get most of the main attributes
in there. The main issue will be the torsions since I do not know how
much progress I can make on that front.

The principle is to work from robustness: to get the spirit of the parm99
parameterization into the smirff, erring on the side of generality not
possible with the atom-type datastructure of parm99.

The approach is to make an intermediate smirffish frcmod file by simply
changing the atom-type path at the start of each parameter in parm99 with
smirks strings, keeping the rest of the format, and then processing this
into a proper smirff ffxml after combining with the smirff-ified
parm@Frosst frcmod into smirff99Frosst.
