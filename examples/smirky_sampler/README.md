Example useage of the "smirky" sampler

This is still in the early stages. 

* StartEmpty_Angle.py 
    - Initializes a TypeSampler from sampler_smirky and proposes moves
    - the decorator lists here are not very refined, this is just a demonstration for using the tool 
* StartEmpty_Angle.log
    - commandline output from StartEmpty_Angle.py
*StartEmpty_Angle.csv
    - Trajectory file from sampling performed in StartEmpty_Angle.py

* correctAtoms.py: begins with chemical environments that match the SMIRFF being used for reference
* the same examples for Bonds, Angles, and Torsions are here as well
