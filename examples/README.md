# Examples for Bayesian atomtype sampler

## Manifest
* `parm@frosst/` - example illustrating attempt to recover parm@frosst atom types
* `AlkEtOH/` - example illustrating attempt to recover parm99 atom types for a small set of alkanes, ethers, and alcohols
* `SMIRFF_comparison/` - temporary example (waiting for permanent home) of cross-comparison of molecule energies from SMIRFF with same molecule energies from .prmtop and .crd.
* `SMIRFF_simulation/` - gives a simple example of simulating a molecule in the gas phase beginning from a molecular structure and the SMIRFF forcefield format.
